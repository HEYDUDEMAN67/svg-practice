# SVG Logo Design Lab

## Overview

In this project, you will design a professional logo using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Unlike images like JPG or PNG, SVG graphics are built with code and scale perfectly to any size without becoming blurry.

Your challenge is to create a logo that is clean, simple, and scalable. It must look good at a small icon size (like an app icon) and at a large display size.

You will build your logo using only SVG elements such as shapes, paths, groups, and text.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Create and structure an inline SVG using a viewBox
2. Use SVG elements such as circle, rect, polygon, path, text, and g
3. Apply transforms like translate() or rotate()
4. Design a logo that works at multiple sizes
5. Follow design constraints to create a clean, professional result
6. Add accessibility features like `<title>` and `<desc>` inside an SVG

## Activity Directions

### Step 1: Choose Your Brand

Select one of the following fictional clients:

- A coffee shop called Northstar Coffee
- A youth esports club called PixelForge
- An outdoor brand called Trail & Tide
- A school tech program called CodeCraft
- A password manager app for teens

### Step 2: Plan Before You Code

On paper or in a notes document:

- Sketch 3 small logo ideas (quick thumbnails)
- Choose your strongest concept

Decide on:

- Brand name
- 2 brand personality traits (modern, bold, playful, calm, premium, techy, friendly, etc.)
- Up to 3 colors

### Step 3: Build Your SVG Logo

Create an HTML file and embed your logo using inline SVG.

Your SVG must:

- Use viewBox="0 0 100 100"
- Fit inside a square layout
- Use no more than 3 colors
- Contain at least 3 shapes
- Include a <g> group with a transform

Include either:

- A path, OR
- Stroke styling (stroke-width, linecap, etc.)

Include accessibility tags:

- `<title>...</title>`
- `<desc>...</desc>`

## Design Rules

- Maximum of 3 colors
- Must work in one color
- Clean spacing and alignment
- No copied logos
- Keep it simple — strong logos are usually simple
